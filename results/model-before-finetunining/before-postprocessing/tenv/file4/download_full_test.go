This is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more edge cases and ensure that the data is encoded and decoded correctly. The `ApplyUrlTranformer` function in the provided code snippet does not actually transform URLs; it simply appends them to a slice. The `UrlTranformer` function is a higher-order function that returns a function capable of transforming URLs based on a rewrite rule.

Remember that the actual implementation of URL transformation can be quite complex and depends on the specific requirements of your application. The above code is a starting point, and you should expand upon it to cover all the scenarios you mentioned, such as input validation, handling different types of errors, and testing edge cases.
